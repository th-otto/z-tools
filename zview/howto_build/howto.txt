Building zView is a little bit complicated but not that much.

1. Download & install shared libraries for freetype, bzip2, exif,
   lzma, tiff, zlib, jpeg & libpng.
   You find them on http://tho-otto.de/sharedlibs.php.
   The archives also contain the static libraries, so it
   should be safe to replace the existant ones.
2. Download & install windom 1.21.3 from http://tho-otto.de/download/mint/windom1-1.21.3-mint-dev.tar.xz.
   A patch, as in previous versions, is no longer neccessary.
3. If you want to also compile zTask and/or zweather,
   you will also need http://tho-otto.de/download/mint/windom-2.0.1-mint-dev.tar.xz.
4. A modified version of the libldg.a is contained in the sources,
   so you no longer to install it.
5. cd zview
6. make
