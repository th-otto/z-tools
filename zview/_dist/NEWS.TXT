(not yet released)
=============================

 News:
 -----

 * NEOIMG module now also handles neochrome master files
   (extended resolution & palette files)
 * JPEG output now also allows to select other colorspaces
 * TGA codec updated with fixes from Lonny's version,
   allowing to load paletted formats, and handle older TGA files 
 * TGA files can now be saved (uncompressed only)
 * Maximum number of codecs increased to 200
 * Different codecs which handle the same file extension are
   now detected
 * JPEG driver now always tries to extract meta-information, even if
   DSP decoder is in use
 * When passing a directory name on startup, zView now
   opens a browser window
 * BMP codec updated with fixes from Lonny's version,
   handling more input formats, and RLE compressed files
 * BMP files can now be saved (uncompressed only)

 Bug Fixes:
 ----------
 * TGA files with right-to-left orientation are now rejected;
   they are not handled by the decoder
 * PNG decoder does not try to display compressed text information
   fields any longer; they are not used to store information that
   should be displayed in the info box
 * JPEG decoder also limits exif data to some reasonable length
 * International text fields in PNG files should now be displayed correctly
   (as long as they can be represented with atari characterset;
   don't expect Japanese or Chinese be displayed there ;)
 * Non-Ascii meta-information in PDF files should now be displayed
   correctly
 * Fixed a bug in the coldfire version that prevented the PNG and
   JPEG plugins from being loaded
 * Fixed a bug in the JPEG decoder that could cause it to crash
   when extracting thumbnail images
 * Non-Ascii meta-information in JPEG files should now be displayed
   correctly
 * Fix a bug in the JPEG DSP decoder that caused the first image line to
   be skipped
 * Fix a bug in decoding monochrome GEM images

 Known Bugs:
 ----------
 * There are still some animated GIFs that are not displayed correctly
 * Some bugs that were reported on Zorro's site (https://sourceforge.net/p/z-tools/bugs/)
 * The HyperText documentation has not yet been updated.
 * The TIFF library sometimes prints warnings on the console
 * The TIFF library per default only supports up to 16 bits/sample (that is,
   48 bits/pixel for RGB formats). Some images from their test archive
   are therefore not displayed
 * Images which have an alpha channel, will store pre-multiplied RGB
   when saving, and loose the alpha-channel


25 August 2019: Version 1.0.2
=============================

First release made by me (Thorsten Otto)

 Notable changes:
 ----------------

 * all codecs recompiled as SLBs, making them much smaller
 * Update PDF library to 4.01.01
 * PDF is now a plugin of its own, only loaded when needed
 * Third-Party-Libraries like TIFF, PNGLIB, ZLIB etc. take up their
   memory only once (ZLIB for example is needed by several modules)
 * Separate versions for 68k, 68020+ and ColdFire are available
 * Degas module now also handles overscan sizes
 
 Bug Fixes:
 ----------
 * Registered file types are not longer restricted to exactly 3 characters.
 * TIFF module will no longer register itself for *.IFF (use *.TIF or *.TIFF
   instead, *.IFF should be reserved for Interchange File Format).
 * Fixes for animated GIFs, mostly taken from Lonny Pursells updated version
 * Fixes for IMG format module, mostly taken from Lonny Pursells updated version.
   Supports now also Hi-Color and True-Color images.

 Known Bugs:
 ----------
 * There are still some animated GIFs that are not displayed correctly
