Version 1.0.2 - 2019/08/xx
=============

First release made by me (Thorsten Otto)

 Notable changes:
 ----------------

 * all codecs recompiled as SLBs, making them
 * much smaller
 * Update PDF library to  4.01.01
 * PDF is now a plugin of its own, only loaded when needed
 * Third-Party-Libraries like TIFF, PNGLIB, ZLIB etc. take up their
   memory only once (ZLIB for example is needed by several modules)
 * Separate versions for 68k, 68020+ and ColdFire are available
 
 Bug Fixes:
 ----------
 * Registered file types are not longer restricted to exactly 3 characters
 * TIFF module will no longer register itself for *.IFF (use *.TIF or *.TIFF
   instead, *.IFF should be reserved for Interchange File Format)
