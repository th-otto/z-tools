The sample images in this directory were not scanned using the ComputerEyes hardware.
They were generated based on the information at the Atari ST Picture Format wiki.
They were then loaded into the ComputerEyes software that came with the hardware and
verified to look ok.

They where also checked with PicSwitch v1.0.1 which does an even better job converting the images.
