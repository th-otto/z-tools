The extra word at the end of a Degas font file:
  “half-height” flag:
     0 = can be rendered at half-height
     1 = font should not not be rendered at half-height

Taken from SilkFont v2.02 documention:

About Degas / Warp 9 fonts
 ==========================

Since Degas and Warp 9 font files contain raw data with no identifying
header, they are detected by length as follows:  A file with length
4096 or 4098 bytes is loaded as a Warp 9 font; one with length 2048 or
2050 bytes is loaded as a Degas font, overwriting just the bottom half
of the character set.  Any other length causes a file to be tested for
GDOS validity, then loaded or rejected as appropriate.

A Degas or Warp 9 font file can generally be interpreted as containing
8x8 or 8x16 data.
