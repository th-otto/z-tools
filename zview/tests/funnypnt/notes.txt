BIRD2.FUN is an animation file, more than one frame.
Note the bird is skewed and the bounding box overwrites part of the mountain.
Funny Paint has serious issues importing NEOchrome animation files.
However, a hand drawn animation should be ok.
This file demonstrates the layout of a multi-frame animation file.
