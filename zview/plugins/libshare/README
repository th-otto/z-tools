libshare 0.1.1 (02 May 2005)
by Arnaud BERCEGEAY <bercegeay@atari.org>

This library is a dirty patch. Its aim is to provide a way to
build shareable library (LDG) compiled against mintlib.

Last changes :

release 0.1.1 (May 2005)
- libshare.h is now _cplusplus compliant
- added experimental (not finished and not tested) functions to manage
  shared memory (U:/SHM/). It's recommended to NOT use them :)

release 0.1.0 (Feb 2004)
- initial release
